# Potential Evapotranspiration Modeling in a Floodplain Forest

## A python implementation of the Priestly-Taylor equations (Priestly and Taylor, 1972) in modeling PET for Congaree National Park

### Collaborators:

 -  [Dr. Timothy Callahan](callahant@cofc.edu)

### Project Goal:  
 - We aim to model the potential evapotranspiration in Congaree National Park for use in a groundwater modeling study. 

### Data:
 - [NREL National Solar Radiation Database ](https://maps.nrel.gov/nsrdb-viewer/ "NSRDB Data Viewer")
 - [Congaree Remote Automated Weather Station, GDNS1](https://mesowest.utah.edu/cgi-bin/droman/mesomap.cgi?state=SC&rawsflag=3 "MesoWest API for Weather Station Data")

### Area of Study:
 Congaree National Park lies in a floodplain forest on the coastal plains of South Carolina, approximately 20 miles southeast of Columbia, SC. The Congaree River marks the southern boundary of the park. The park is maintained by the National Park Service, and hosts over 150,000 visitors per year.
